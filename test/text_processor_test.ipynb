      "Better understanding of the quality of life among nursing home residents with dementia is important for developing interventions. The objectives of this cross-sectional study were to examine factors associated with poor health-related quality of life in older people with dementia living in nursing homes in Hanoi, Vietnam. In-person interviews were conducted with 140 adults who were 60 years and older with dementia, and information about their quality of life was obtained using the Quality of Life in Alzheimer’s Disease (QOL-AD) scale. The sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with poor health-related quality of life (lowest quartile) were assessed through the results of physical tests, interviews with nursing home staff, and review of medical records. The average age of the study sample was 78.3 years, 65% were women, and their average QOL-AD total score was 27.3 (SD = 4.4). Malnutrition, total dependence in activities of daily living, and urinary incontinence were associated with poor quality of life after controlling for multiple potentially confounding factors. Our findings show that Vietnamese nursing home residents with dementia have a moderate total quality of life score, and interventions based on comprehensive geriatric assessment remain needed to modify risk factors related to poor health-related quality of life.\n",

      "----------------\n",
      "\n",
      "Dementia is a chronic, progressive, and usually irreversible deterioration in cognition that is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality \\[[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B1-ijerph-21-00135),[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B2-ijerph-21-00135)\\]. Globally, the number of people affected by dementia has been increasing during the past several decades, over two-thirds of whom live in low- and middle-income countries, including Vietnam \\[[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B3-ijerph-21-00135)\\]. Since there is currently no cure for dementia, care services are focused on improving or maintaining quality of life in adults with dementia \\[[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B4-ijerph-21-00135)\\].\n",
      "\n",
      "Quality of life (QOL) refers to “a person’s perception of their position in life in the context of the culture and value systems in which they live and in relation to their goals, expectations, standards and concerns” \\[[5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B5-ijerph-21-00135)\\]. An individual’s quality of life is personal and subjective and differs between individuals due to their values, life circumstances, and socio-cultural factors. However, measuring quality of life in dementia is challenging because people with more severe cognitive dysfunction have more difficulty with giving their own perceptions. There are several self-report and proxy-report instruments developed for the assessment of QOL in people with dementia, and the most commonly used instrument is the Quality of Life in Alzheimer’s Disease (QOL-AD) scale \\[[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B6-ijerph-21-00135)\\].\n",
      "\n",
      "To know what interventions should be focused on to improve quality of life, the factors associated with poor QOL need to be determined. A large number of studies have investigated factors associated with QOL but there is no consensus on variables related to QOL of people with dementia \\[[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B4-ijerph-21-00135),[7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B7-ijerph-21-00135)\\]. The presence of geriatric syndromes and co-incidence of geriatric syndromes is common and may result in worsening of QOL among people with dementia \\[[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B6-ijerph-21-00135),[8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B8-ijerph-21-00135),[9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B9-ijerph-21-00135),[10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B10-ijerph-21-00135)\\]. However, assessment of geriatric syndromes is often overlooked in studies among this population. Most previous studies have only revealed that variables such as depressive symptoms, behavioral and psychological disturbance, cognitive functions, and dependence in activities of daily living were most consistently related to low QOL of people with dementia \\[[7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B7-ijerph-21-00135),[11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B11-ijerph-21-00135)\\].\n",
      "\n",
      "While there is an increasing number of older individuals living in nursing homes with dementia \\[[12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B12-ijerph-21-00135)\\], little is known about their QOL or factors influencing the health-related QOL of older men and women with dementia living in nursing home settings. In a previous study conducted in eight nursing homes in Vietnam, it was shown that older people in nursing homes in Vietnam had a moderate level quality of life \\[[13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B13-ijerph-21-00135)\\]. However, there is a lack of data on QOL in people with dementia living in nursing homes in Vietnam. Better understanding of the quality of life among nursing home residents with dementia is important for developing interventions to improve their quality of life and disease management. The objectives of this cross-sectional study were to measure health-related QOL and identify factors associated with poor health-related QOL among older adults with dementia living in several nursing homes in Hanoi, Vietnam.\n",

      "A cross-sectional study was conducted on older adults with dementia living in three nursing home facilities (Orihome, Nhan Ai, Dien Hong Nursing Center) in Hanoi, Vietnam from November 2022 through January 2023.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Hanoi, there are presently 20 private nursing homes. The nursing homes included in this study were selected using cluster sampling based on their size: (Small cluster): facility with less than 100 residents; (Medium cluster): facility with 100 to 200 residents; and (Large cluster): facility with more than 200 residents. We then used random sampling to select institutions in each cluster.\n",

      "### 2.2. Study Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria\n",
      "\n",
      "Long-stay residents (of at least 3 months) at the three participating nursing homes were eligible for study consideration if they were 60 years or older and had a diagnosis of dementia according to DSM 5 criteria \\[[15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B15-ijerph-21-00135)\\], as determined by a neuropsychiatrist from the research team at the time of study recruitment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exclusion criteria were if participants had severe loss of hearing or vision, were unable to communicate (according to the interRAI Community Health Assessment) \\[[16](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B16-ijerph-21-00135)\\] or unable to answer questions about QOL, were unwilling to participate in the study, or if their family did not consent for them to take part in the study.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2.3. Data Collection\n",
      "\n",
      "The research team consisted of five researchers and two neuropsychiatrists. Prior to recruiting study participants, members of the study team completed a training program on participant screening and study data collection methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "After initial screening, participants and their families and nursing home care staff received a complete explanation of the purpose, procedures, and risks of the study. The informed consent of the participants and their families was obtained if they showed interest in participating.\n",
      "\n",
      "Data were obtained through four approaches: (1) in-person interviews with study participants; (2) examination of the participants, including physical tests such as the Timed Up & Go (TUG) test and a 30 s chair stand test (30 s CST); (3) interviews with the nursing home care staff; and (4) review of nursing home records. Study participants and nursing home care staff were interviewed separately using a structured questionnaire.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 2.3.1. Health-Related Quality of Life\n",
      "\n",
      "Health-related QOL, this study’s primary outcome, was assessed using the QOL in Alzheimer’s Disease (QOL-AD) scale through the conduct of in-person interviews \\[[17](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B17-ijerph-21-00135)\\]. The QOL-AD consists of 13 items (energy, physical health, mood, memory, living situation, family, friends, marriage, self as a whole, ability to do things for fun, ability to do chores, and views of money and life), each of which is rated on a four-point scale: 1—poor, 2—fair, 3—good, and 4—excellent. The total QOL-AD score is the sum of scores from 13 items which range from 13–52 points, with higher scores indicating higher QOL. The internal consistency for the QOL-AD was determined using Cronbach’s alpha. For all 13 items on the scale, the α was 0.77; values above α = 0.70 are considered as evidence of acceptable internal consistency. Each resident’s total QOL-AD score was further categorized according to quartiles as: poor QOL (lowest quartile), moderate QOL (second and third quartiles), and high QOL (highest quartile) based on the distribution of the data and according to what were considered to be clinically meaningful cut-points of QOL.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 2.3.2. Other Study Variables\n",
      "\n",
      "Nursing home paper records were reviewed by members of the research team for the following data on the long-stay residents: age (classified into 3 groups: 60–69 years old, 70–79 years old, 80 years old and over), gender (male, female), marital status (married, divorced/separated, widowed, never married), education level (no formal, primary level, secondary level, college degree or higher), current smoking and drinking, polypharmacy (concurrent use of 5 or more medications \\[[18](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B18-ijerph-21-00135)\\]), and comorbidity (defined as the co-occurrence of more than one disease).\n",
      "\n",
      "Data on each resident’s level of cognition was determined using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) through in-person interviews by the research team. It is an 11-question measure that tests domains of cognitive function: orientation, registration, attention and calculation, recall, and language. A lower score of MMSE is indicative of greater cognitive decline \\[[19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B19-ijerph-21-00135)\\]. Physical function was assessed using the TUG and 30 s CST. For the TUG, participants performed the test twice at the participant’s normal speed and their best time of completion was recorded. \\[[20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B20-ijerph-21-00135)\\]. The 30 s CST consists of counting the number of sit-stand-sit cycles completed during the 30 s test \\[[21](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B21-ijerph-21-00135)\\], where a cutoff score of 11.25 indicates high risk of falls \\[[22](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B22-ijerph-21-00135)\\].\n",
      "\n",
      "Nursing home care staff were interviewed to assess the presence of geriatric syndromes in study participants. These included nutritional status, functional ability, incontinence, sleep disturbance, and behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia. Nutritional status was determined using the Mini Nutritional Assessment Scale-Short Form (MNA-SF), an instrument with scores ranging from 0 to 14 points. A total score of MNA-SF <8, 8–11, and \\>11 indicates malnutrition, risk of malnutrition, and no malnutrition, respectively. \\[[23](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B23-ijerph-21-00135)\\]. Functional ability was assessed using the activities of daily living (ADLs) Barthel index, which measures the extent to which somebody can function independently and has mobility in their ADLs with 5 categories (independent: 100 points, slight dependency: 91–99 points, moderate dependency: 61–90 points, severe dependency: 21–60 points and total dependency: 0–20 points) \\[[24](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B24-ijerph-21-00135)\\]. Presence of incontinence was determined using three Incontinence Questions (3IQ) \\[[25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B25-ijerph-21-00135)\\]. Sleep disturbance was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), which contains 19 questions with a range of 0–21 points, where a score greater than five demonstrates poor sleep quality \\[[26](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B26-ijerph-21-00135)\\]. Number of geriatric syndromes was recorded, including polypharmacy, poor sleep quality, malnourished, dependence in ADLs, urinary incontinence, comorbidity, high risk of falls, and depression. If a participant had 2 or more geriatric syndromes, he or she was considered to be multimorbidity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dementia-related characteristics such as feeding difficulties and behavioral and psychological symptoms were also assessed via interviewing the nursing home care staff. Feeding difficulties were assessed using the Edinburgh Feeding Evaluation in Dementia (EdFED) scale, which is an instrument designed to assess eating and feeding problems in people with late-stage dementia; total scores range from 0 to 20, with 20 being the most serious \\[[27](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B27-ijerph-21-00135)\\]. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) questionnaire was used to assess behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), including agitation/aggression (total scores range from 0 to 96), depression (total scores range from 0 to 96), and delusional symptoms (total scores range from 0 to 108). Each behavioral symptom was calculated using its total score (frequency × severity), with higher scores indicating greater severity \\[[28](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B28-ijerph-21-00135)\\].\n",

      "In this cross-sectional study, we investigated the relationship between geriatric syndromes such as malnutrition, total dependence in ADLs, and urinary incontinence and poor health-related QOL among older adults with dementia residing in nursing homes in Vietnam.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vietnam is one of the world’s fastest-aging countries with an increasing number of older individuals with dementia \\[[29](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B29-ijerph-21-00135)\\]. Policy makers are attempting to build health care models to improve the QOL of these individuals \\[[29](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B29-ijerph-21-00135)\\]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study examining health-related QOL among men and women 60 years and older with dementia living in nursing homes in Vietnam. We found that nursing home residents had, on average, a moderate total QoL-AD score.\n",
      "\n",
      "The average QOL-AD scores reported in our study were low compared to previous findings in nursing home residents with dementia living in industrialized countries who used similar study questionnaires \\[[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B4-ijerph-21-00135),[30](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B30-ijerph-21-00135)\\]. For example, a study in eight European countries showed that their average QOL-AD total score was 32.5 (SD = 6.3), ranging from 28.2 (6.2) in Estonia to 35.8 (SD = 5.3) in Sweden \\[[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B4-ijerph-21-00135)\\]. The result from nursing homes in the south of the Netherlands showed that the average QOL-AD total score was 37.3 (SD = 4.7) \\[[30](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B30-ijerph-21-00135)\\]. These differences can likely be explained by the fact that these earlier studies were conducted in industrialized countries that have different social care systems, healthcare organizations, cultural norms, policy frameworks, family involvement during the care process, and attitudes towards nursing home placement \\[[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B4-ijerph-21-00135)\\]. Notably, in Vietnam, individuals with dementia often stay at home and are only placed in nursing home facilities when their cognitive impairment is severe and their caring needs exceed the capacity of their families. The lower average QOL in this study population may also reflect the fact that residents in other countries enter nursing homes at earlier stages of their disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "The QoL-AD scale is a widely used instrument of QoL assessment in dementia. Our study is the first categorizing QoL-AD according to quartiles, as follows: poor QOL (lowest quartile), moderate QOL (second and third quartiles), and high QOL (highest quartile). According to this classification, low QoL-AD was associated with adverse events: being malnourished, total dependence in ADLs, urinary incontinence, feeding difficulties, declines in physical function, and increased number of geriatric syndromes. This study focused on identifying factors associated with poor health-related quality of life among older adults with dementia living in several nursing homes in Hanoi, Vietnam. From these results, we will know which interventions nursing homes should focus on developing to improve their quality of life and disease management.\n",
      "\n",
      "We observed that a high proportion of participants reported lower QOL in domains related to their physical health, ability to do chores and things for fun, and poor memory. While many studies have used proxies to report QOL among individuals with dementia \\[[31](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B31-ijerph-21-00135)\\], we asked nursing home residents to self-report their QOL. This approach was taken because individuals with dementia and their caregivers may not perceive QOL in the same way \\[[32](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B32-ijerph-21-00135)\\], and we sought to identify those aspects of living that are most meaningful to individuals with dementia. Our findings suggest that interventions focusing on physical, social, and cognitive domains should be implemented and evaluated for their effectiveness in enhancing the QOL of individuals with dementia living in nursing homes in Vietnam.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our results confirmed a high prevalence of multimorbidity among older adults with dementia. All participants were reported having at least two geriatric syndromes. The number of geriatric syndromes in the poor QOL group was higher than those in the high/moderate QOL group. Our research findings show support for evidence from previous studies that indicated the presence and co-incidence of geriatric syndromes were highly prevalent among older adults with dementia \\[[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B6-ijerph-21-00135),[8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B8-ijerph-21-00135),[9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B9-ijerph-21-00135),[10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B10-ijerph-21-00135)\\]. A geriatric assessment is often overlooked in many studies among older adults with dementia due to cognitive impairments that make the assessment more difficult and complicated \\[[33](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B33-ijerph-21-00135)\\]. Our study revealed that geriatric assessments can be applied to older people with dementia in nursing homes and that the assistance of the caregiver plays an important role in the geriatric assessment process. Previous studies showed that older adults with multimorbidity are at greater risk for worse adverse outcomes \\[[34](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B34-ijerph-21-00135),[35](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B35-ijerph-21-00135),[36](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B36-ijerph-21-00135),[37](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B37-ijerph-21-00135),[38](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B38-ijerph-21-00135)\\]. They may have functional impairment or a poorer QOL and overall health status \\[[37](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B37-ijerph-21-00135),[38](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B38-ijerph-21-00135)\\]. Furthermore, they experience greater health services use, such as more frequent inpatient hospitalizations, longer lengths of stay when hospitalized, and increased emergency admissions \\[[36](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B36-ijerph-21-00135),[37](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B37-ijerph-21-00135)\\]. A geriatric assessment should be identified early to build effective strategies for identifying patients with multiple conditions and initiating prevention and intervention strategies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our cross-sectional epidemiological study examined the association between low health-related QOL in older individuals with dementia and modifiable risk factors such as their geriatric syndromes. We found malnutrition, total dependence in activities of daily living, and the presence of urinary incontinence were associated with poor QOL, but a longitudinal study would be necessary to analyze this relationship. These findings underscore the importance of conducting a comprehensive geriatric assessment, which encompasses domains including urinary continence, physical function, and nutrition, since it enables the identification of potential problems and facilitates the implementation of various interventions and approaches to enhance nursing home residents’ overall health-related QOL.\n",

      "### Study Strengths and Limitations\n",
      "\n",
      "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate health-related QOL among older individuals with dementia residing in nursing homes in Vietnam.

The results of this study should be interpreted with caution, however, due in part to the inherent limitations of cross-sectional studies. This study’s sample size was relatively modest, and participants in this study were recruited from nursing homes, potentially limiting their representativeness to older community dwelling residents.\n",

      "5\\. Conclusions\n",
      "---------------\n",
      "\n",
      "Older individuals with dementia residing in nursing homes in Hanoi, Vietnam generally have a moderate total QoL-AD score. Key challenges include their less-than-optimal physical health, ability to perform chores, poor memory, and need for engagement in enjoyable activities. We recommend interventions targeting these areas to enhance the health-related QOL for this population. Additionally, addressing modifiable risk factors such as malnutrition, activities of daily living, and urinary incontinence through comprehensive geriatric assessment and management is crucial for improving their overall QOL.\n",

      "{'Abstract': 'Better understanding of the quality of life among nursing home residents with dementia is important for developing interventions. The objectives of this cross-sectional study were to examine factors associated with poor health-related quality of life in older people with dementia living in nursing homes in Hanoi, Vietnam. In-person interviews were conducted with 140 adults who were 60 years and older with dementia, and information about their quality of life was obtained using the Quality of Life in Alzheimer’s Disease (QOL-AD) scale. The sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with poor health-related quality of life (lowest quartile) were assessed through the results of physical tests, interviews with nursing home staff, and review of medical records. The average age of the study sample was 78.3 years, 65% were women, and their average QOL-AD total score was 27.3 (SD = 4.4). Malnutrition, total dependence in activities of daily living, and urinary incontinence were associated with poor quality of life after controlling for multiple potentially confounding factors. Our findings show that Vietnamese nursing home residents with dementia have a moderate total quality of life score, and interventions based on comprehensive geriatric assessment remain needed to modify risk factors related to poor health-related quality of life. **Keywords:** Vietnam, dementia, older adult, quality of life, nursing home, related factors', '1\\\\.

Since there is currently no cure for dementia, care services are focused on improving or maintaining quality of life in adults with dementia \\\\[(https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B4-ijerph-21-00135)\\\\]. Quality of life (QOL) refers to “a person’s perception of their position in life in the context of the culture and value systems in which they live and in relation to their goals, expectations, standards and concerns” \\\\[(https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B5-ijerph-21-00135)\\\\]. An individual’s quality of life is personal and subjective and differs between individuals due to their values, life circumstances, and socio-cultural factors. However, measuring quality of life in dementia is challenging because people with more severe cognitive dysfunction have more difficulty with giving their own perceptions. There are several self-report and proxy-report instruments developed for the assessment of QOL in people with dementia, and the most commonly used instrument is the Quality of Life in Alzheimer’s Disease (QOL-AD) scale \\\\[(https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B6-ijerph-21-00135)\\\\]. To know what interventions should be focused on to improve quality of life, the factors associated with poor QOL need to be determined. A large number of studies have investigated factors associated with QOL but there is no consensus on variables related to QOL of people with dementia \\\\[(https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B4-ijerph-21-00135),(https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B7-ijerph-21-00135)\\\\]. The presence of geriatric syndromes and co-incidence of geriatric syndromes is common and may result in worsening of QOL among people with dementia \\\\[(https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B6-ijerph-21-00135),(https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B8-ijerph-21-00135),(https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B9-ijerph-21-00135),(https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B10-ijerph-21-00135)\\\\]. However, assessment of geriatric syndromes is often overlooked in studies among this population. Most previous studies have only revealed that variables such as depressive symptoms, behavioral and psychological disturbance, cognitive functions, and dependence in activities of daily living were most consistently related to low QOL of people with dementia \\\\[(https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B7-ijerph-21-00135),(https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B11-ijerph-21-00135)\\\\]. While there is an increasing number of older individuals living in nursing homes with dementia \\\\[(https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B12-ijerph-21-00135)\\\\], little is known about their QOL or factors influencing the health-related QOL of older men and women with dementia living in nursing home settings. In a previous study conducted in eight nursing homes in Vietnam, it was shown that older people in nursing homes in Vietnam had a moderate level quality of life \\\\[(https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B13-ijerph-21-00135)\\\\]. However, there is a lack of data on QOL in people with dementia living in nursing homes in Vietnam. Better understanding of the quality of life among nursing home residents with dementia is important for developing interventions to improve their quality of life and disease management. The objectives of this cross-sectional study were to measure health-related QOL and identify factors associated with poor health-related QOL among older adults with dementia living in several nursing homes in Hanoi, Vietnam.', '2\\\\. Materials and Methods': '', '2.1. Study Setting': 'A cross-sectional study was conducted on older adults with dementia living in three nursing home facilities (Orihome, Nhan Ai, Dien Hong Nursing Center) in Hanoi, Vietnam from November 2022 through January 2023. In Hanoi, there are presently 20 private nursing homes. The nursing homes included in this study were selected using cluster sampling based on their size: (Small cluster): facility with less than 100 residents; (Medium cluster): facility with 100 to 200 residents; and (Large cluster): facility with more than 200 residents. We then used random sampling to select institutions in each cluster. Target population: older adults with dementia living in nursing homes in Hanoi, Vietnam. Source population: older adults living in private nursing homes that were listed in the Report Market outlook 2021 in Hanoi \\\\[(https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B14-ijerph-21-00135)\\\\]. Sampling frame: 11 private nursing home systems were licensed to operate at the time of the study in 2022 ([Table 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#ijerph-21-00135-t001)).', 'Table 1.': 'Sampling frame of nursing home facilities in Hanoi, Vietnam \\\\[(https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B14-ijerph-21-00135)\\\\]. | N | Facilities | Size | | --- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---- | | 1 | Dien Hong Nursing Center (4 campuses) \\\\* | L | | 2 | Bach Nien Thien Duc Aged Care Center (3 campuses) | L | | 3 | Lotus Aged Care Center | M | | 4 | Nhan Ai Aged Care Center \\\\* | M | | 5 | Tuyet Thai Aged Care Center | M | | 6 | Ha Noi Nursing Center (2 campuses) | M | | 7 | Javilink Nursing Home System (2 campuses) | S | | 8 | KAIGO Nursing Center (2 campuses) | S | | 9 | ALH Nursing Home | S | | 10 | OriHome Aged Care Center \\\\* | S | | 11 | FDC Elder Nursing Home | S | The final study sample consisted of one large cluster (Dien Hong Nursing Center), one medium cluster (Nhan Ai Aged Care Center), and one small cluster nursing home (OriHome Aged Care Center).

In the Nhan Ai Aged Care Center, the number of staff was 36 and the yearly mortality rate in the observation period was 8.8%. In the OriHome Aged Care Center, the number of staff was 15 and the yearly mortality rate in the observation period was 8.8%. All three nursing homes have no relationship with hospitals.', '2.2. Study Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria': 'Long-stay residents (of at least 3 months) at the three participating nursing homes were eligible for study consideration if they were 60 years or older and had a diagnosis of dementia according to DSM 5 criteria \\\\[(https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B15-ijerph-21-00135)\\\\], as determined by a neuropsychiatrist from the research team at the time of study recruitment. Exclusion criteria were if participants had severe loss of hearing or vision, were unable to communicate (according to the interRAI Community Health Assessment) \\\\[(https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B16-ijerph-21-00135)\\\\] or unable to answer questions about QOL, were unwilling to participate in the study, or if their family did not consent for them to take part in the study.', '2.3. Data Collection': 'The research team consisted of five researchers and two neuropsychiatrists. Prior to recruiting study participants, members of the study team completed a training program on participant screening and study data collection methods. After initial screening, participants and their families and nursing home care staff received a complete explanation of the purpose, procedures, and risks of the study. The informed consent of the participants and their families was obtained if they showed interest in participating. Data were obtained through four approaches: (1) in-person interviews with study participants; (2) examination of the participants, including physical tests such as the Timed Up & Go (TUG) test and a 30 s chair stand test (30 s CST); (3) interviews with the nursing home care staff; and (4) review of nursing home records. Study participants and nursing home care staff were interviewed separately using a structured questionnaire.', '2.3.1. Health-Related Quality of Life': 'Health-related QOL, this study’s primary outcome, was assessed using the QOL in Alzheimer’s Disease (QOL-AD) scale through the conduct of in-person interviews \\\\[(https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B17-ijerph-21-00135)\\\\]. The QOL-AD consists of 13 items (energy, physical health, mood, memory, living situation, family, friends, marriage, self as a whole, ability to do things for fun, ability to do chores, and views of money and life), each of which is rated on a four-point scale: 1—poor, 2—fair, 3—good, and 4—excellent. The total QOL-AD score is the sum of scores from 13 items which range from 13–52 points, with higher scores indicating higher QOL. The internal consistency for the QOL-AD was determined using Cronbach’s alpha. For all 13 items on the scale, the α was 0.77; values above α = 0.70 are considered as evidence of acceptable internal consistency. Each resident’s total QOL-AD score was further categorized according to quartiles as: poor QOL (lowest quartile), moderate QOL (second and third quartiles), and high QOL (highest quartile) based on the distribution of the data and according to what were considered to be clinically meaningful cut-points of QOL.', '2.3.2. Other Study Variables': 'Nursing home paper records were reviewed by members of the research team for the following data on the long-stay residents: age (classified into 3 groups: 60–69 years old, 70–79 years old, 80 years old and over), gender (male, female), marital status (married, divorced/separated, widowed, never married), education level (no formal, primary level, secondary level, college degree or higher), current smoking and drinking, polypharmacy (concurrent use of 5 or more medications \\\\[(https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B18-ijerph-21-00135)\\\\]), and comorbidity (defined as the co-occurrence of more than one disease). Data on each resident’s level of cognition was determined using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) through in-person interviews by the research team. It is an 11-question measure that tests domains of cognitive function: orientation, registration, attention and calculation, recall, and language. A lower score of MMSE is indicative of greater cognitive decline \\\\[(https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B19-ijerph-21-00135)\\\\]. Physical function was assessed using the TUG and 30 s CST. For the TUG, participants performed the test twice at the participant’s normal speed and their best time of completion was recorded. \\\\[(https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B20-ijerph-21-00135)\\\\]. The 30 s CST consists of counting the number of sit-stand-sit cycles completed during the 30 s test \\\\[(https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B21-ijerph-21-00135)\\\\], where a cutoff score of 11.25 indicates high risk of falls \\\\[(https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B22-ijerph-21-00135)\\\\]. Nursing home care staff were interviewed to assess the presence of geriatric syndromes in study participants. These included nutritional status, functional ability, incontinence, sleep disturbance, and behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia. Nutritional status was determined using the Mini Nutritional Assessment Scale-Short Form (MNA-SF), an instrument with scores ranging from 0 to 14 points. A total score of MNA-SF <8, 8–11, and \\\\>11 indicates malnutrition, risk of malnutrition, and no malnutrition, respectively. \\\\[(https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B23-ijerph-21-00135)\\\\]. Functional ability was assessed using the activities of daily living (ADLs) Barthel index, which measures the extent to which somebody can function independently and has mobility in their ADLs with 5 categories (independent: 100 points, slight dependency: 91–99 points, moderate dependency: 61–90 points, severe dependency: 21–60 points and total dependency: 0–20 points) \\\\[(https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B24-ijerph-21-00135)\\\\]. Presence of incontinence was determined using three Incontinence Questions (3IQ) \\\\[(https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B25-ijerph-21-00135)\\\\]. Sleep disturbance was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), which contains 19 questions with a range of 0–21 points, where a score greater than five demonstrates poor sleep quality \\\\[(https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B26-ijerph-21-00135)\\\\]. Number of geriatric syndromes was recorded, including polypharmacy, poor sleep quality, malnourished, dependence in ADLs, urinary incontinence, comorbidity, high risk of falls, and depression. If a participant had 2 or more geriatric syndromes, he or she was considered to be multimorbidity. Dementia-related characteristics such as feeding difficulties and behavioral and psychological symptoms were also assessed via interviewing the nursing home care staff. Feeding difficulties were assessed using the Edinburgh Feeding Evaluation in Dementia (EdFED) scale, which is an instrument designed to assess eating and feeding problems in people with late-stage dementia; total scores range from 0 to 20, with 20 being the most serious \\\\[(https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B27-ijerph-21-00135)\\\\]. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) questionnaire was used to assess behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), including agitation/aggression (total scores range from 0 to 96), depression (total scores range from 0 to 96), and delusional symptoms (total scores range from 0 to 108). Each behavioral symptom was calculated using its total score (frequency × severity), with higher scores indicating greater severity \\\\[(https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B28-ijerph-21-00135)\\\\].', '2.4. Data Analysis': 'Baseline characteristics were compared between the adults with poor and moderate/high QOL. These data were presented as percentages for categorical variables and as means ± standard deviation for continuous variables. The distribution of the total QOL-AD score was examined and was found to be normally distributed ([Figure 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#ijerph-21-00135-f001)). We also calculated internal consistency for the QOL-AD by calculating the Cronbach’s alpha (α = 0.70).', 'Figure 1.': '[![Image 1: Figure 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/d21c/10888023/c0d43db58dd8/ijerph-21-00135-g001.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=10888023_ijerph-21-00135-g001.jpg) Distribution of total QOLAD scores. Poor health-related QOL was defined among the group with the lowest quartile of QOLAD scores. Moderate QOL was defined as inclusion in the second and third quartiles of the QOLAD scores and those with a high QOL were categorized as those in the uppermost quartile of the QOLAD scores. We examined several factors associated with poor health-related QOL (vs. moderate/high QOL) in older adults with dementia using univariate and multivariable adjusted logistic regression models. These factors included sociodemographic characteristics, polypharmacy, PSQI score, malnutrition, dependence in Barthel ADLs, TUG test, Edinburgh score, comorbidities, the agitation, depression, and delusion scores from the BPSD, 30 s CST test, and the MMSE score. Potential factors associated with the QOL-AD score in the univariate analysis at a threshold of _p_\\\\-value less than 0.20 were entered in our multivariable adjusted logistic regression models.

Study Population Characteristics': 'A total of 164 participants with dementia were eligible for participation. Of these participants, two (1.22%) were not willing to participate, eight (4.88%) had severe loss of vision or hearing or were unable to communicate, two others (1.22%) were transferred to another nursing home center, and twelve (7.31%) had severe dementia and could not answer questions about their QOL. A total of 140 participants were included for the present analysis. The mean (SD) age of the study sample was 78.3 (+/−8.7) years, females accounted for 65%, and half of the participants (51.43%) were widowed.

Policy makers are attempting to build health care models to improve the QOL of these individuals \\\\[(https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B29-ijerph-21-00135)\\\\]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study examining health-related QOL among men and women 60 years and older with dementia living in nursing homes in Vietnam. We found that nursing home residents had, on average, a moderate total QoL-AD score. The average QOL-AD scores reported in our study were low compared to previous findings in nursing home residents with dementia living in industrialized countries who used similar study questionnaires \\\\[(https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B4-ijerph-21-00135),(https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B30-ijerph-21-00135)\\\\]. For example, a study in eight European countries showed that their average QOL-AD total score was 32.5 (SD = 6.3), ranging from 28.2 (6.2) in Estonia to 35.8 (SD = 5.3) in Sweden \\\\[(https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B4-ijerph-21-00135)\\\\]. The result from nursing homes in the south of the Netherlands showed that the average QOL-AD total score was 37.3 (SD = 4.7) \\\\[(https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B30-ijerph-21-00135)\\\\]. These differences can likely be explained by the fact that these earlier studies were conducted in industrialized countries that have different social care systems, healthcare organizations, cultural norms, policy frameworks, family involvement during the care process, and attitudes towards nursing home placement \\\\[(https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B4-ijerph-21-00135)\\\\]. Notably, in Vietnam, individuals with dementia often stay at home and are only placed in nursing home facilities when their cognitive impairment is severe and their caring needs exceed the capacity of their families. The lower average QOL in this study population may also reflect the fact that residents in other countries enter nursing homes at earlier stages of their disease. The QoL-AD scale is a widely used instrument of QoL assessment in dementia. Our study is the first categorizing QoL-AD according to quartiles, as follows: poor QOL (lowest quartile), moderate QOL (second and third quartiles), and high QOL (highest quartile). According to this classification, low QoL-AD was associated with adverse events: being malnourished, total dependence in ADLs, urinary incontinence, feeding difficulties, declines in physical function, and increased number of geriatric syndromes. This study focused on identifying factors associated with poor health-related quality of life among older adults with dementia living in several nursing homes in Hanoi, Vietnam. From these results, we will know which interventions nursing homes should focus on developing to improve their quality of life and disease management. We observed that a high proportion of participants reported lower QOL in domains related to their physical health, ability to do chores and things for fun, and poor memory. While many studies have used proxies to report QOL among individuals with dementia \\\\[(https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B31-ijerph-21-00135)\\\\], we asked nursing home residents to self-report their QOL. This approach was taken because individuals with dementia and their caregivers may not perceive QOL in the same way \\\\[(https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B32-ijerph-21-00135)\\\\], and we sought to identify those aspects of living that are most meaningful to individuals with dementia. Our findings suggest that interventions focusing on physical, social, and cognitive domains should be implemented and evaluated for their effectiveness in enhancing the QOL of individuals with dementia living in nursing homes in Vietnam. Our results confirmed a high prevalence of multimorbidity among older adults with dementia. All participants were reported having at least two geriatric syndromes. The number of geriatric syndromes in the poor QOL group was higher than those in the high/moderate QOL group. Our research findings show support for evidence from previous studies that indicated the presence and co-incidence of geriatric syndromes were highly prevalent among older adults with dementia \\\\[(https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B6-ijerph-21-00135),(https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B8-ijerph-21-00135),(https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B9-ijerph-21-00135),(https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B10-ijerph-21-00135)\\\\]. A geriatric assessment is often overlooked in many studies among older adults with dementia due to cognitive impairments that make the assessment more difficult and complicated \\\\[(https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B33-ijerph-21-00135)\\\\]. Our study revealed that geriatric assessments can be applied to older people with dementia in nursing homes and that the assistance of the caregiver plays an important role in the geriatric assessment process. Previous studies showed that older adults with multimorbidity are at greater risk for worse adverse outcomes \\\\[(https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B34-ijerph-21-00135),(https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B35-ijerph-21-00135),(https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B36-ijerph-21-00135),(https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B37-ijerph-21-00135),(https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B38-ijerph-21-00135)\\\\]. They may have functional impairment or a poorer QOL and overall health status \\\\[(https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B37-ijerph-21-00135),(https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B38-ijerph-21-00135)\\\\]. Furthermore, they experience greater health services use, such as more frequent inpatient hospitalizations, longer lengths of stay when hospitalized, and increased emergency admissions \\\\[(https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B36-ijerph-21-00135),(https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888023#B37-ijerph-21-00135)\\\\]. A geriatric assessment should be identified early to build effective strategies for identifying patients with multiple conditions and initiating prevention and intervention strategies. Our cross-sectional epidemiological study examined the association between low health-related QOL in older individuals with dementia and modifiable risk factors such as their geriatric syndromes. We found malnutrition, total dependence in activities of daily living, and the presence of urinary incontinence were associated with poor QOL, but a longitudinal study would be necessary to analyze this relationship. These findings underscore the importance of conducting a comprehensive geriatric assessment, which encompasses domains including urinary continence, physical function, and nutrition, since it enables the identification of potential problems and facilitates the implementation of various interventions and approaches to enhance nursing home residents’ overall health-related QOL.', 'Study Strengths and Limitations': 'To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate health-related QOL among older individuals with dementia residing in nursing homes in Vietnam. Our findings have important implications for the type of clinical services required for the care of these older adults. The results of this study should be interpreted with caution, however, due in part to the inherent limitations of cross-sectional studies. This study’s sample size was relatively modest, and participants in this study were recruited from nursing homes, potentially limiting their representativeness to older community dwelling residents.', '5\\\\. Conclusions': 'Older individuals with dementia residing in nursing homes in Hanoi, Vietnam generally have a moderate total QoL-AD score. Key challenges include their less-than-optimal physical health, ability to perform chores, poor memory, and need for engagement in enjoyable activities. We recommend interventions targeting these areas to enhance the health-related QOL for this population. Additionally, addressing modifiable risk factors such as malnutrition, activities of daily living, and urinary incontinence through comprehensive geriatric assessment and management is crucial for improving their overall QOL.', 'Acknowledgments': 'This research was supported by the Board of Directors and medical staff at the Dien Hong Nursing Center, Nhan Ai Aged Care Center, and OriHome Aged Care Center in Hanoi, Vietnam.

[PMC Copyright notice](/about/copyright/) PMCID: PMC11320145 PMID:', '2. Abstract': \"The threat posed by Alzheimer's disease (AD) to human health has grown significantly. However, the precise diagnosis and classification of AD stages remain a challenge. Neuroimaging methods such as structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) have been used to diagnose and categorize AD. However, feature selection approaches that are frequently used to extract additional data from multimodal imaging are prone to errors. This paper suggests using a static pulse-coupled neural network and a Laplacian pyramid to combine sMRI and FDG-PET data. After that, the fused images are used to train the Mobile Vision Transformer (MViT), optimized with Pareto-Optimal Quantum Dynamic Optimization for Neural Architecture Search, while the fused images are augmented to avoid overfitting and then classify unfused MRI and FDG-PET images obtained from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) datasets into various stages of AD. The architectural hyperparameters of MViT are optimized using Quantum Dynamic Optimization, which ensures a Pareto-optimal solution. The Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), the Mean Squared Error (MSE), and the Structured Similarity Indexing Method (SSIM) are used to measure the quality of the fused image. We found that the fused image was consistent in all metrics, having 0.64 SIMM, 35.60 PSNR, and 0.21 MSE for the FDG-PET image. In the classification of AD vs. cognitive normal (CN), AD vs. mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and CN vs. MCI, the precision of the proposed method is 94.73%, 92.98% and 89.36%, respectively. The sensitivity is 90. 70%, 90. 70%, and 90. 91% while the specificity is 100%, 100%, and 85. 71%, respectively, in the ADNI MRI test data. **Keywords:** Alzheimer's disease, Pareto optimization, Deep learning, Classification, Image fusion, Multimodal\", '2. 1. Introduction': \"AD and the neurodegenerative processes that drive dementia have emerged as the leading global health issue, with far-reaching consequences for individuals, families, and healthcare systems. AD, which accounts for 60 - 80% of all cases of dementia, is the most common cause of cognitive decline and memory impairment in the elderly population [](#br0010). Throughout the years, great scientific effort has been dedicated to deciphering the complicated mechanisms behind neurodegeneration [](#br0020), investigating possible biomarkers for early diagnosis [](#br0030), creating targeted therapies, and promoting risk reduction techniques. As the population ages, the prevalence of AD and other neurological disorders increases, which encourages scientists to study more deeply the biomarkers and environmental variables that influence the vulnerability of the disease [](#br0040). Early diagnosis of AD is crucial for timely intervention and treatment. The combination of sMRI and FDG-PET through collaborative generative adversarial networks addresses this challenge by enabling a more comprehensive and accurate assessment, potentially facilitating earlier detection and intervention strategies. However, this has remained a challenge due to the complexity of disease progression. Multimodal neuroimaging methods were utilized to solve several limitations of AD diagnosis by combining MRI and FDG-PET through collaborative generative adversarial networks [](#br0050). Although numerous therapeutic trials have produced promising results, the complexity of neurodegeneration requires more research in multimodal neuroimaging techniques to ensure timely initiation of treatment, maximize therapeutic efficacy, and minimize potential adverse effects. Another important part of neurodegenerative research has been the search for accurate and accessible biomarkers [](#br0060). Biomarkers provide crucial information on disease development, allowing early diagnosis and helping to track therapy responses. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis and neuroimaging methods such as FDG-PET and MRI have shown promise in diagnosis [](#br0070). This, in conjunction with modern machine learning techniques, has enormous potential to enable quick intervention and facilitate data analysis. FDG-PET and related methods are crucial in the investigation of AD, offering vital insights into the underlying molecular processes of the disease [](#br0080). FDG-PET uses radiotracers to view and quantify particular biomarkers in the brain [](#br0090), providing a non-invasive way to investigate AD [](#br0100). FDG-PET biomarkers combined with the power of machine learning help in early identification, disease progression monitoring, and distinguishing AD from other neurodegenerative diseases with comparable clinical signs [](#br0110). The effectiveness of FDG-PET has allowed the identification of those at risk of developing Alzheimer's disease before major cognitive symptoms appear, providing new pathways for early intervention and potential disease-modifying treatment options [](#br0120). Furthermore, the ability of FDG-PET to monitor changes in amyloid-beta and tau deposits over time provides vital information on disease progression, helping researchers describe the evolution of AD and its influence on cognitive decline. Although being a vital tool, this method has drawbacks, such as its high cost, limited availability, and exposure to ionizing radiation. Efforts are being made to provide more accessible and cost-effective PET tracers, as well as to improve image analysis techniques, to increase sensitivity and specificity [](#br0130). FDG-PET imaging offers a way to visualize the metabolic activity of brain cells, helping to locate abnormal regions by measuring the level of glucose metabolism. FDG-PET can help diagnose and choose treatment for various neurological diseases by focusing on these alterations [](#br0140), thus becoming more valuable in distinguishing between normal and pathological findings, unlike structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), which provides information on the anatomical structure of the brain exclusively [](#br0150). The regions that are most useful for distinguishing the stages of AD according to their mean relative metabolic rate of cerebral glucose include the midcingulate cortex, the angular, superior temporal, middle frontal, and superior frontal gyri [](#br0160). It is a reliable biomarker for AD, but it is insufficient to identify the earliest phases of MCI [](#br0170). With sMRI, machine learning approaches are increasingly being employed to help analyze AD phases. These technologies could help reveal crucial details about the structure of the brain [](#br0180). The ability of sMRI to show different patterns of brain atrophy makes it useful for identifying AD. The great resolution of the soft tissue on sMRI makes it much more helpful in the diagnosis of AD [](#br0190). Combining FDG-PET imaging with sMRI features offers an additional method to classify AD into different stages [](#br0200), [](#br0210). Researchers can better understand the underlying mechanisms of the disease by combining these two modalities. This strategy might increase the precision of the early analysis and treatment results [](#br0220). In AD research, multiscale fusion approaches that combine MRI and PET data have been developed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the pathophysiology of AD [](#br0230), [](#br0240). These techniques take advantage of the strengths of both imaging modalities and promise to reveal previously inaccessible information, leading to a better diagnosis, monitoring, and management of AD. The two-dimensional Fourier transform (FT) and the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) [](#br0250) were used in the fusion process, which combined MRI and PET images [](#br0260). Furthermore, the method of medical image fusion was implemented using the multiscale decomposition of the medical image pyramid to improve human visual understanding [](#br0270). SIMM achieved by the method was better compared to other methods. Our main contribution is a novel technique to integrate Gaussian decomposition and the Laplacian Pyramid (LP) coupled with the Spatial Pulsed Neural Coupling Network (SPCNN) in the image-fusion task for AD stage classification. Before combining the sMRI and FDG-PET images, different weights were assigned to various spatial frequencies. This helped to emphasize the characteristics that were most important for classifying the stages of AD, and MViT is used to train the fused image and is adapted to work with sMRI and FDG-PET images, rather than having to use separate models for each modality. The architectural hyperparameters of the MViT model are optimized using Quantum Dynamic Optimisation (QDO) for higher performance in AD stage classification.\", '2. 2. Review of related ML based methods': 'The stages of AD classification were achieved employing a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, which was trained using both FDG-PET and sMRI images [](#br0280), [](#br0290). The SVM was trained using extracted Grey Matter (GM) from FDG-PET as a feature. The GM served as the basis for classification in the AD staging process. Similarly, the accurate inherent similarity that is shared between sMRI and FDG-PET modality data was captured to select complementary features for the SVM-based classifier for the classification of AD stages [](#br0300), [](#br0310). The characteristics of the brain region of interest (ROI) in the sMRI and FDG-PET data are extracted using a template [](#br0320). Complementary features are further selected on the basis of a consistent metric, and SVM was used for the classification of AD stages. Based on t statistics, ROIs with the highest t values were identified from sMRI and FDG-PET images for the classification of AD [](#br0330). To classify the stages of AD, a new composite image was generated by blending the region of brain GM tissue in sMRI and FDG-PET images using mask and registration coding techniques [](#br0340). Researchers have classified individuals with AD according to their GM density and glucose based on sMRI and FDG-PET, allowing a more comprehensive and accurate diagnosis of AD [](#br0350). A three-dimensional convolutional network was used for the classification of AD stages, in which a Sparse autoencoder was added to the network to increase the description of the characteristics for classification [](#br0360). Similarly, a hypergraph-based framework was used that introduced a specialized hypergraph-based regularization to explicitly represent the high-order relationship in MRI and FDG-PET modality for the classification of AD stages [](#br0350). The requirement for the selection of multimodal features derives from the fact that the features received from many modalities are inherently interconnected and have a high degree of dimension [](#br0370). To avoid overfitting and improve the generalizability of the results, highly correlated or duplicated features are frequently removed [](#br0380). This is often achieved in supervised learning using feature selection methods. By eliminating irrelevant or redundant traits, these strategies such as the feature-weighted scheme [](#br0280), greedy search [](#br0390), sparsity regularization [](#br0400), relational regularization [](#br0410), maximum expectation [](#br0420), and random forest incorporation [](#br0430) help identify and retain the most informative information in multimodal neuroimaging. The goal of feature selection is to simplify the data and prioritize the most valuable features that can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, enabling the creation of effective classification or prediction models for AD. However, multiple imaging techniques, each with unique scales, resolutions, noise levels, and informational contents, are used in multimodal neuroimaging. It may be difficult to integrate information between modalities due to this variance [](#br0440). Therefore, the distinctive qualities of each modality must be carefully considered when integrating multimodal neuroimaging data. The current feature selection techniques used to choose complementary data from sMRI and FDG-PET have not been able to handle feature variability well [](#br0270). Additionally, the selected feature subset is also inconsistent. These issues have impacted the general accuracy and reliability of these methods. A multiscale decomposition algorithm can be used to combine spatial information from multimodal images [](#br0270). With the help of the algorithm, which divides the images into various scales, useful information can be extracted at each scale. A more complete comprehension of the images can be achieved by merging the data from each scale. The pyramid is used in the decomposition of medical imaging, which incorporates numerous scales [](#br0450). This method aims to enhance human visual comprehension of medical images. The stages of AD were classified using the initial ResNet model, based on combined sMRI and FDG-PET images that were obtained using the DWT and FT methods, the model was trained [](#br0260). For the purpose of classifying the stages of AD, the demon algorithm and DWT enabled the perfect fusion of sMRI and FDG-PET [](#br0460). Accurate differentiation between various stages of AD has been shown to be possible with the help of this pair of imaging techniques. The distinct advantages and complementary features of each imaging modality are responsible for the effectiveness of this approach. 3D DWT and 3D moment-invariant features of the sMRI and FDG-PET images were fused to classify AD stages [](#br0470). For the analysis of sMRI and FDG-PET data, the DWT was enhanced with the pre-trained VGG16 network. The final fused image was then constructed using the inverse DWT, which was used to evaluate a pre-trained ViT for AD classification [](#br0480). The low frequency subbands and the high frequency subbands are fused using the maximum selection rule and the modified spatial frequency for AD classification [](#br0490). The use of Laplacian LP and SPCNN demonstrated a good use of multimodal information [](#br0500). ViT has achieved excellent results in image recognition and classification with a single transformer encoder to learn global representations [](#br0510). The simple ViT model trains faster and better than the original ViT [](#br0520), the performance of ViTs saturates rapidly when scaled to be deeper and improves the accuracy of the image classification [](#br0530). Although MViT allowed for light-weight global processing of information with transformers [](#br0540).', '2. 3. Methods': 'The proposed method uses a fused image from the T1-weighted MRI of the whole brain and the FDG-PET image from the ADNI-1 data set to identify different stages of AD, including AD in the dementia stage, MCI due to AD, and cognitive normal (CN), which is often known as healthy control. The main goal of this method is to recognize the different phases of AD. The integration of data from both imaging methods aims to improve the precision and dependability of AD diagnosis. sMRI and FDG-PET images are enhanced using the sharpening technique before being reduced to scales. By combining Gaussian and LP (GLP) and SPCNN, it is possible to fuse sMRI and FDG-PET images of the same class. Using fused images, MViT is trained to identify the stages of AD. Unfused sMRI and FDG-PET images are used to test the accuracy of the method. Therefore, by using unfused test data sets, the efficiency of MViT in diagnosing the stages of AD can be assessed. [Fig. 1](#fg0010) shows the block diagram of our proposed technique.', '3. Figure 1.': '[Open in a new tab](figure/fg0010/) Proposed Multimodal Approach Framework.', '3. 3.1. Data and image acquisition': 'To gather high-quality data for this study, T1-weighted magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) techniques, along with radio frequency field (B1) and image intensity nonuniformity correction (N3) imaging methods, were considered while downloading MRI sequences from the ADNI and OASIS databases. Men and women of 42 to 95 years of age were evaluated according to the clinical dementia rating (CDR) and the minimental state assessment, which are clinical selection criteria used in the ADNI database that provide information on overall cognitive status. Because there is no access to postmortem pathological data, in vivo biomarkers, such as amyloid deposition, were not included in our selection criteria. FDG obtained by co-registration of a structural scan anatomical image was considered for FDG-PET images downloaded from the ADNI database. The ADNI and OASIS databases allow users to obtain whole-brain sMRI and PET images in the NIFTI format. For the MRI from ADNI database, 167 subjects across AD, CN, and MCI stages that gives best representation was selected out of 195 AD, 714 CN, and 654 MCI with respect to class bias. Likewise for the FDG-PET from ADNI database 190 subjects across AD, CN, and MCI stages that gives best representation was selected out of 195 AD, 714 CN, and 654 MCI with respect to class bias. Whole-brain magnetic resonance imaging must be analyzed slice by slice. Therefore, the slices needed for this research project are extracted using MRIcroGL software, a free 3D viewer for medical imaging data that can display NIFTI files and allow for slice extraction. During the extraction of slices from the volume brain image using MRIcroGL, the software preserves the original spatial resolution of the image, i.e. the extracted slices retained the same pixel dimensions and voxel sizes as the original volume. The selection of slices was based on a careful consideration of several factors aimed at ensuring the quality and relevance of the chosen MRI slices. A rigorous selection process was considered to include only the middle slices that contain the most relevant information for our research objectives. Specifically, this study focused on axial slices, which are known to provide a comprehensive view of the brain in a horizontal orientation from the base to the top of the skull. This choice is particularly beneficial for consistent anatomical comparisons across subjects and reduces the risk of partial volume effects that are more prevalent in other planes. The slices were chosen to demonstrate consistency across the class, considering the number of subjects involved in the study. The selected slices were required to exhibit optimal image quality. This criterion was essential to guarantee clear and accurate anatomical details in the MRI data. Slices with any artifacts or degradation in image quality were excluded from the final selection. Focusing on the middle slices of the MRI volume was a deliberate choice. These slices were selected because they offer a good representation of the overall brain anatomy. Middle slices are less susceptible to artifacts commonly found at the edges of the acquisition volume, ensuring a more reliable depiction of the brain structures. 167 subjects are selected per class for ADNI with an average of 6 slices each for MRI while an average of 190 subjects per class are selected per class for PET with an average of 7 slices per class. The total number of slices extracted for each of the classes is shown in [Table 1](#tbl0010). #### Table 1. Total Number of Slices Extracted from PET and MRI NIFTI Images for Fusion.

Application of the Laplacian model for FDG-PET and sMRI': \"This study uses both image normalization and enhancement methods. Images are improved by using image filtering techniques, including kernel-based sharpening. Additionally, to guarantee uniformity across all photos, global normalization is used as the normalization step. To improve the sharpness and definition of an image's edges and details, a technique known as “kernel-based sharpening” is used. When the filter and the image are combined, the high-frequency elements of the image are amplified. Using a high-pass filter, it is possible to enhance high-frequency elements of an image. With the use of this filter, the low-frequency details in the image are carefully removed because they could contribute to blurriness or lack of sharpness, leaving only the high-frequency details. The image is thus crisper and more detailed. The high-pass filter or kernel is created using a mathematical model called the Laplacian. The second derivative of a function in a multidimensional space is described by the Laplacian operator. The Laplacian operator is discretized and approximated as a convolution kernel to create the kernel. The Laplacian equation serves as the basis for the kernel design. After that, the high-pass filter is implemented using this kernel. The generated kernel is then used with convolution to enhance high-frequency edges and features. Mathematically, the Laplacian model for FDG-PET and sMRI is shown in Equations [(1)](#fm0010) and [(2)](#fm0020). FDG−PET′(n,m)=FDG−PET(n,m)−[Hfdg−pet(n,m)⁎FDG−PET(n,m)] | (1) ---|--- sMRI′(n,m)=sMRI(n,m)−[Hsmri(n,m)⁎sMRI(n,m)] | (2) ---|--- where FDG−PET′(n,m) and sMRI′(n,m) indicate the target image of FDG-PET and the target image of sMRI, respectively, while FDG−PET(n,m) and sMRI(n,m) represents FDG-PET source image (enhanced image) and the sMRI source image (enhanced image), respectively. The high pass filter kernel for FDG-PET and sMRI is indicated by Hfdg−pet(n,m) and Hsmri(n,m), respectively, while ⁎ denotes a 2D convolution operation. Hsmri(n,m), Hfdg−pet(n,m) is given by [−1,−1,−1],[−1,9,−1],[−1,−1,−1]. The Laplacian kernel is a 3x3 filter with a center weight of 9 and surrounding weights of -1. High Pass Filters are applied to the FDG-PET and sMRI images, respectively, with the purpose of improving the high-frequency components while attenuating the low-frequency components. By convolving the original images with these high-pass filters, the fine details and edges within the images are emphasized, leading to improved image quality. Although there may indeed be visual similarities between kernel-based sharpening and standard windowing of contrasts, the underlying mechanisms and outcomes of these techniques diverge significantly. Kernel-based sharpening involves the application of advanced image processing algorithms that improve local details and edges by adjusting the pixel intensities based on neighboring information [](#br0550), [](#br0560). On the other hand, standard windowing primarily focuses on adjusting the image's brightness and contrast levels within specific intensity ranges to highlight specific features. [Fig. 2](#fg0020) shows the original image and enhanced image for MRI and PET. Metrics such as the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio PSNR, SSIM, and MSE are employed to assess the improved and fused image quality. The combination of these parameters allowed us to fully evaluate the image quality. The quality of the images improves as the PSNR increases. The similarity between the two images is measured by SSIM. The quality of the image improves as the SSIM number approaches 1. The average squared difference between the base image and the enhanced image is what MSE calculates. The quality of the image improves with decreasing MSE. #### Figure 2.

AD - Alzheimer Disease; MCI - Mild Cognitive Impairment; CN - Cognitive Normal; Original - Image before sharpening; Enhanced - Image after Sharpening.\", '3. 4.2. Laplacian pyramid': 'LP functions at multiple scales and resolutions and is a very efficient image processing technique [](#br0570). Images can be broken down into layers with varying resolutions by analyzing them at various scales, which allows for the view of details such as edges, textures, and other details. As the size decreases, these layers have more and more finer details. Consequently, this method enables a more thorough understanding of the content and structure of an image. The result of the reconstruction procedure can be obtained by fusing the matching layers of many source images (enhanced image) separately to create a fused pyramid. The existence of artifacts is one major flaw of LP. The quality of the fused images may suffer from these problems. Sumiya et al. [](#br0580) created a solution for the problem by introducing a simple and adaptable GLP. The GLP method applies a sequence of Gaussian filters to the image at every level, resulting in a reduced high-frequency content and eliminating any noise or artifacts. The adaptability of the method enables the user to balance the smoothness and detail of the image by customizing the blurring level and scale. When GLP is implemented, the image becomes clearer and more visually appealing. The image is converted into a Gaussian pyramid using Gaussian decomposition, and the Laplacian pyramid of the image is produced by a differential operation based on the Gaussian Pyramid (GP) [](#br0590), [](#br0600).', '3. 4.3. SPCNN': \"A neural network known as SPCNN is used during the merging process of sMRI and FDG-PET images. This network is built to help neurons communicate with pulsed signals. The SPCNN can successfully blend data from numerous images to obtain a more complete and accurate output [](#br0610). The network consists of neurons, each of which might represent a pixel of the input images. The pulsed signals of the neurons, which are delivered to the matching pixels, carry the information communicated between them. As a result, the network can analyze visual data by looking at patterns in pulsed signals. Pulsed neural coupling networks are frequently used in numerous tasks, including image segmentation, pattern recognition, target categorization, and image fusion [](#br0600). The feedback network in the pulsed neural coupling network model is made up of several neurons coupled in a single layer [](#br0620). Equations [(3)](#fm0030) and [(4)](#fm0040) mathematically express the pulsed neural coupling network that consists of two matrices. This network incorporates the neural connection process and functions in a pulsed manner. a(k,l)=m(k,l)+β⁎[b(k−1,y)+b(k+1,y)+b(k,l−1)+b(k,l+1)] | (3) ---|--- bnew(k,l)=bold(k,l)⁎exp(θ)+a(k,l)⁎[1−exp(θ)] | (4) ---|--- where: a(k,l) and bnew(k,l) =output images obtained after each iteration of the algorithm, bold(k,l) =the current output image obtained before next iteration of the algorithm., m(k,l) = source image from GLP, _a_ and _b_ = matrix which are initially zeros, _k_ and _l_ = spatial coordinates of the image _β_ =decay factor _θ_ = threshold value. _exp_ = exponential function. The matrices a and b have the same size as the input image, that is, each element in these matrices corresponds to a pixel in the input image. These matrices are updated at each iteration based on equation [(3)](#fm0030) and [(4)](#fm0040) respectively. Equation [(4)](#fm0040) involves a recursive step in which b (k, l) appears on both sides of the equation because the new value of the function is calculated based on the initial value. Equation [(4)](#fm0040) is a recursive definition for updating the values of the output image b (k,l). On the left-hand side,b (k,l) represents the current value of the pixel at coordinates k,l in the output image b. The right-hand side of the equation calculates a new value for b (k,l) based on its current value and other factors. Each pixel's value is recursively updated based on its current value, which helps refine and enhance features in the output image across multiple iterations of the algorithm. Equations [(3)](#fm0030) and [(4)](#fm0040) are applied iteratively to produce the final fused image.\", '3. 4.4. MRI and PET image fusion': 'To combine MRI and PET images across several modalities, GLP and SPCNN are used. By merging the data from the two different types of images, the target area is represented more accurately and comprehensively. To provide a multiscale representation of the MRI and PET input images, two sets of GP are built. This method enables a more thorough study of the photos at various scales. The multiscale depiction of GP makes it easier to spot patterns and characteristics that might not be discernible on a single scale. The Gaussian pyramids are used to create Laplacian pyramids, and between each level of the pyramid and its extended version, a subtraction operation is carried out. At each level of the pyramid, the left and right halves of the images are connected using the horizontal stack method. The concatenation of arrays along the horizontal axis results in the final merged image. After upsampling and integrating the merged images, the final image is reconstructed using the Laplacian pyramid, and then SPCNN is used. SPCNN further processes and enhances the fused image, potentially improving its accuracy and quality. It also provides the spatial relationships between the corresponding regions in the MRI and PET images. This network takes into account the local context and spatial information. However, its effectiveness with the GLP is highly dependent on the quality of the input images. To obtain the final fused image seen in [Fig. 3](#fg0030), the SPCNN output is normalized to the range [0, 255]. #### Figure 3. [Open in a new tab](figure/fg0030/) Outcome of Gaussian Laplacian pyramid methods.', '3. 4.5. Augmentation': 'A set of image transformations [](#br0630), was applied to the sMRI, FDG-PET, to increase the data set. The applied transformations were implemented using the PyTorch ‘transforms’ module, which provides a range of image manipulation. The following transformations were used: RandomRotation(45) rotates the image by a degree between -45 and +45 degrees, RandomHorizotalFlip(p=0.5) flips the image horizontally at random with a probability of 0.5, and RandomVerticalFlip(p=0.5) randomly flips the image vertically with a probability of 0.5.', '3. 4.6. Application of deep learning using MViT': \"The MViT model is a variation of the ViT model created especially for use on mobile devices [](#br0640). The architecture is designed with several key features: * • Multiscale Feature Hierarchies. There are many channel resolution scaling steps in MViT. The stages increase the channel capacity while decreasing the spatial resolution in a hierarchical manner, starting with the input resolution and a modest channel size. As a result, a multiscale pyramid of features is formed, with the early levels modeling basic low-level visual information at high spatial resolution and the deeper layers at spatially coarse but complex high-dimensional characteristics. * • Decomposed Relative Positional Embeddings. MViT incorporates decomposed relative positional embeddings. This technique encodes the relative position between two input elements, which only depends on the relative location distance between tokens in the pooled self-attention computation, important for maintaining shift invariance in vision tasks. * • Residual Pooling Connections. MViT uses residual pooling connections, which adds the pooled query tensor to the output sequence, increasing information flow and facilitating the training of pooling attention blocks in MViT. * • Pooling Attention. MViT uses a clustering attention mechanism to reduce the computation and memory complexity in attention blocks, which is particularly important for high-resolution object detection and space-time video understanding tasks, although it also significantly increases the computation complexity due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention operators in transformers. * • Hybrid Window Attention. MViT employs a hybrid window attention scheme that can complement pooling attention for better accuracy/compute trade-off, which is needed for object detection tasks that require high-resolution inputs and feature maps. In addition to these features, MViT has the ability to effectively handle limited data scenarios, in contrast to traditional computational neural networks (CNNs). MViT's efficiency lies in its ability to capture long-range dependencies and spatial relationships using self-attention mechanisms, while requiring fewer computational resources compared to CNNs [](#br0650). Taking advantage of the transformer architecture, MViT can efficiently process and extract meaningful features from small datasets, making it an appropriate choice for our study, where limited data availability is a crucial factor. The 256x256 input images were used in our suggested model, and a list of numbers (96, 120, 144) was used to define the hidden dimensions at various resolution levels. For each layer of the model, we also specified the number of channels using a list of integers (16, 32, 48, 48, 64, 64, 80, 80, 96, 96, 384). The output of the MViT model is produced by combining a conventional 3X3 convolutional layer and a 1X1 convolutional layer. The 1X1 convolutional layer converts the input tensor into a high-dimensional space by learning linear combinations of the input channels, while the 3X3 convolutional layer collects local spatial features. Our implementation of the proposed model was developed in Python using the PyTorch framework, an open source machine learning library built on top of Tensorflow. The suggested approach for AD image classification demonstrates efficient and accurate processing, which requires only 1.2 seconds per image on a computer with an Intel® CoreTM i5-6400 processor, 8 GB of RAM and Windows 10. Compared to using only the CPU, using a dedicated GPU (we tested on Nvidia 1650) for greater parallel processing capabilities can boost the computation speed for AD picture classification jobs by tenfold or more, which makes the approach suitable for a wide range of computer settings. Before training, hyperparameters are established to assist in the learning process and the refinement of the model through the adjustment of various hyperparameters, including batch size (ranging from 8 to 32), learning rate (ranging from 0.01 to 0.0003), number of epochs (ranging from 10 to 30), optimators (Adam, AdamW, and stochastic gradient descent), and weight decay (0.5 and 0.05). The optimal parameters of our proposed model were determined to be a weight decrease of 0.05, an SGD optimizer, and 30 epochs, while the learning rate for each binary classification was set at 0.002. The training data set consisted of 60% of the fused images, and the remaining 40% was used for validation. Data augmentation, regularization (dropout=0.3), and learning rate scheduler was utilized to control over fitting. Additionally, an independent test data set was used comprising individuals from the ADNI and OASIS databases to validate the proposed model. Only demographic criteria was used to create the test data and slices were extracted from each subject and the selection of specific slices was performed using the MRIcroGL software. The test data set contained no fused images and no splitting is required as the data are independent data from ADNI and OASIS. The total number of slices extracted for each of the classes is shown in [Table 2](#tbl0020). #### Table 2. Total Number of Slices Extracted from PET and MRI NIFTI Images for test data.

Finally, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the model in predicting the test images were evaluated.\", '3. 4.7. Neural architecture search': 'The Neural Architecture Search (NAS) uses a search strategy to find the next architecture to be evaluated, and an evaluation strategy to assess its performance [](#br0660), [](#br0670). Formally, NAS problem can be defined as follows: minimizeA∈AL(A;Dtrain)subject toL(A;Dval)≤ϵ,Cost(A)≤κ, | (5) ---|--- Here: _A_ represents the architecture of the neural network. A is the search space for all possible architectures. L(A;Dtrain) is the loss function that measures the performance of architecture _A_ in the training data set Dtrain L(A;Dval) is the loss function that measures the performance of architecture _A_ in the validation data set Dval _ϵ_ is the maximum allowable validation loss. Cost(A) is a function that measures the computational cost of architecture _A_. _κ_ is the maximum computational cost allowable. The goal of NAS is to find an architecture _A_ that minimizes training loss, while also ensuring that validation loss and computational cost do not exceed their respective thresholds.', '3. 4.8. Pareto-optimal QDO algorithm': \"Pareto-Optimal QDO Algorithm refers to an optimization algorithm that uses principles of quantum computing and Pareto optimality. Quantum computing leverages quantum bits (qubits) to perform computations, potentially offering exponential speed-up for certain tasks [](#br0680). Pareto optimality, on the other hand, is a concept in multi-objective optimization where a solution is considered Pareto optimal if there is no other solution that can improve one objective without worsening at least one other objective [](#br0690). The {(QDO) [](#br0700), is an iterative optimization algorithm based on a quantum dynamic process. The pseudocode of the algorithm is presented in [Algorithm 1](#fg0040). Here, the population _P_ consists of _N_ individuals, each representing a potential solution. The fitness fi of an individual _i_ is evaluated and the best solution Pbest is updated if fi is better. The velocity vi of each individual is updated using a quantum dynamic equation, which is not specified here because it would depend on the specific implementation of the QDO algorithm. The position xi of each individual is updated by adding the velocity to the current position. Gaussian sampling is applied to xi to introduce randomness and promote exploration of the search space. The position xi is discretized using a threshold function to convert the continuous position into a discrete solution. The worst individual in the population is replaced by the mean of the population to maintain diversity and avoid premature convergence. The algorithm continues until a termination condition is met, such as reaching a maximum number of iterations or achieving a desired level of fitness. The best solution found is then returned. #### Algorithm 1. [Open in a new tab](figure/fg0040/) Quantum Dynamic Optimization Algorithm. A quantum dynamic equation used in the QDO algorithm is a simplified version of the Schrödinger equation [](#br0710), which is a fundamental equation in quantum mechanics: zħ∂∂tΨ(r,t)=[−ħ22m∇2+V(r,t)]Ψ(r,t) | (6) ---|--- here * • _z_ is the imaginary unit, which is defined as z=−1. * • _ħ_ is the reduced Planck constant, which is a fundamental constant in quantum mechanics. It is related to the Planck's constant _h_ by ħ=h2π. * • ∂∂t is the partial derivative with respect to time _t_. This operator is used to calculate the rate of change of the wave function with respect to time. * • Ψ(r,t) is the wave function of the system, which is a function of position **r** and time _t_. The wave function contains all the information about the state of a quantum system. * • −ħ22m∇2 is the kinetic energy operator, where _m_ is the mass of the particle and ∇2 is the Laplacian operator. The Laplacian operator is a differential operator that calculates the divergence of the gradient of a function. * • V(r,t) is the potential energy, which can depend on position **r** and time _t_. The potential energy represents the energy caused by the position of the particle in a potential field. Equation [(6)](#fm0060) describes how the wave function of a quantum system evolves over time. In the context of a QDO algorithm, the wave function could represent the state of the optimization problem, and the potential energy could represent the fitness function. The algorithm would then use this equation to update the state of the system in each iteration, with the goal of finding the state that minimizes the fitness function. In a QDO, these variables would be interpreted as follows: The wave function Ψ(r,t) represents the state of the optimization problem. The potential energy V(r,t) represents the fitness function of the optimization problem. The kinetic energy operator represents the exploration of the search space. The time evolution of the wave function represents the iterative process of the optimization algorithm.\", '3. 4.9. Pareto-optimality of QDO algorithm': 'In the context of the QDO Algorithm, Pareto-optimality could be used to guide the search process when there are multiple conflicting objectives to optimize. For example, in a neural architecture search problem, one might want to minimize both the prediction error and the complexity of the neural network architecture. These two objectives are typically conflicting, as reducing the prediction error often requires more complex architectures, while reducing the complexity often leads to higher prediction error. The QDO algorithm can be adapted to handle such multi-objective problems by maintaining a population of solutions and using Pareto dominance to guide the selection of solutions. Specifically, a solution for reproduction would be selected if it is not dominated by any other solution population in terms of all objectives. A solution x⁎ is Pareto-optimal if there does not exist another solution _x_ such that fi(x)≤fi(x⁎) for all objectives _i_ and fj(x)<fj(x⁎) for at least one objective _j_ , where fi(x) is the value of the _i_ -th objective function at solution _x_. Here: * • x⁎ is a potential Pareto-optimal solution. This is a solution that we are considering as a candidate for Pareto-optimality. * • _x_ is another solution. This is a solution that we compare with the candidate solution x⁎. * • fi(x) is the value of the _i_ -th objective function at solution _x_. This represents the performance of solution _x_ with respect to the _i_ -th objective. * • The inequality fi(x)≤fi(x⁎) means that the _i_ -th objective value of solution _x_ is not worse than that of solution x⁎. In other words, solution _x_ does not perform worse than solution x⁎ with respect to the _i_ -th objective. * • The inequality fj(x)<fj(x⁎) means that the _j_ -th objective value of solution _x_ is better than that of solution x⁎. In other words, solution _x_ performs better than solution x⁎ with respect to at least one objective. * • If both of the above conditions are met, then solution x⁎ is not Pareto-optimal, because there exists another solution _x_ that performs equally well or better in all objectives and better in at least one objective. If no such solution _x_ exists, then solution x⁎ is Pareto-optimal.', '3. 4.10. Ablation study': 'To perform an ablation study on proposed approach for the classification of stages of AD using fused images that combine sMRI and FDG-PET, we systematically remove specific components of the approach to evaluate the contribution of each segment of the approaches to the overall performance. Firstly, MViT is trained on fused image without sharpening and SPCNN. Secondly, MViT is trained on images fused without sharpening. Lastly, MViT is trained on images fused without SPCNN. The advantage of conducting the ablation in this manner lies in its ability to determine whether the sharpening algorithm and SPCNN fusion technique are essential components for improving the quality and informativeness of the fused image in classification of AD stages.', '3. 4.11. Visualization of MViT based multimodal fused images with gradient class activation map': 'All fused images were inputted to train the MViT model. For visualizing the region using the MViT model used for the decision in classification, we used the Gradient Class Activation Map (Grad-CAM). CAM of the target class is usually upsampled to the size of the input image to obtain fine-grained pixel-scale representations [](#br0720). The idea of CAM is to generate the output map instead of a value that represents the probability of AD [](#br0730). Grad-CAM is a class-discriminative localization technique that generates visual explanations for any CNN-based network without requiring architectural changes or re-training [](#br0740). It weighs the 2D activations by the average gradient [](#br0750).', '2. 5. Results': \"The experimental environment used for this study is PyTorch deep learning framework with the Jupyter notebook based on the Ubuntu 16.04 operating system and the Windows 10 operating system. Preprocessing techniques were implemented on windows 10. The software used is Python 3.9.11 and the MRIcroGL software version 1.2. Using three metrics, namely SSIM, PSNR, and MSE, the quality of the fused images was assessed. SSIM measure the similarity between two images, and a value close to 1 or exactly indicates a perfect similarity, PSNR compares two images in terms of their pixel values in which higher PSNR values indicate a higher quality image, while MSE provides a quantitative measure of the overall difference between the two images. The results of the experiments are reported at the subject level to ensure a comprehensive and cohesive presentation. The analysis involves the fusion of information from selected slices for each individual subject. The concatenation method is used to combine the relevant information from different slices within each subject. Specifically, the results from individual slices for a given subject are merged to create a comprehensive summary of that subject's data. Furthermore, how each value for each subject differs from each other is not significant, so the average of the values for all subjects in a class is considered as the final value.

The MViT model integrated the merged MRI-PET images and had a resolution of 256 x 256 pixels for its input image, as shown in the proposed fusion approach, to maintain the same resolution as the original images before fusion to ensure the fidelity of the fused result. The model architecture includes 11 ViT layers, each containing a series of transformer blocks resembling the original ViT design.

Visualization of regions used for classification': \"We visualized the regions related to AD dementia, CN and MCI using the MViT model. The brain metabolic region and the structural region related to AD, CN and MCI were localized on individual fused images. 4 sample images are visualized from AD, CN, and MCI class as shown in [Fig. 6](#fg0070), [Fig. 7](#fg0080), and [Fig. 8](#fg0090), respectively. #### Figure 6.

[Open in a new tab](figure/fg0090/) Grad-CAM Visualization for MCI Class. The areas highlighted in [Fig. 6](#fg0070) by the warmer colors on the Grad-CAM heat maps are consistent with regions known to be associated with Alzheimer's disease, particularly those involved with memory and spatial orientation, such as the hippocampus [](#br0780) and parietal regions [](#br0760). The occipital focus in the first image is less typical for Alzheimer's disease, which may suggest that the model is identifying atypical patterns or that the image captures a different aspect of the disease. The analysis of the highlighted regions can be summarized as follows: * • In the first image on the left, there is a significant hotspot in the posterior part of the brain, which usually corresponds to the occipital lobe, which is primarily associated with visual processing, or potentially the posterior parietal region. * • The second image shows a pronounced focus of activity in the central to posterior region of the brain. This can potentially indicate attention towards the parietal lobe or the posterior cingulate cortex, which are regions involved in various cognitive functions and can be affected in Alzheimer's disease [](#br0760), [](#br0770). * • The third image also shows activity in a central region, but with an extension towards the anterior part. This pattern often implies a focus on the limbic structures such as the hippocampus and surrounding areas of the medial temporal lobe, which are critical in memory and are often affected in Alzheimer's disease [](#br0780). * • In the fourth image, there is a concentration of warmer colors towards the posterior and somewhat towards the central region, which potentially indicate the posterior cingulate [](#br0770) or the precuneus [](#br0790), both of which are involved in memory and spatial orientation and are often areas of interest in Alzheimer's research. The highlighted regions in [Fig. 7](#fg0080) can be connected to areas known to be involved in cognitive processes and could be areas of interest in conditions such as cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease: * • The first image from the left shows a concentration of warmer colors in the central to slightly posterior part of the brain, which potentially indicate the parietal lobe or posterior cingulate cortex [](#br0770). * • The second image has a hotspot in the central region but more towards the top of the brain, which suggest the model is focusing on the superior part of the brain possibly related to the parietal lobe or the precuneus. * • The third image has warmer colors in the central region, similar to the first image, indicating the same brain regions like the parietal lobe or posterior cingulate cortex. * • The fourth image displays a concentration of warmer colors toward the anterior and middle portions of the brain, indicating regions like the frontal lobe, which is associated with executive functions, and parts of the limbic system, potentially including the hippocampus, which is central to memory processing. The regions shown in [Fig. 8](#fg0090) correspond to areas typically implicated in Alzheimer's disease and MCI research: * • The middle sections of the brain correspond to areas like the hippocampus and surrounding medial temporal lobe structures, are important for memory and are often the focus in studies related to cognitive impairments and Alzheimer's disease [](#br0780). * • The areas toward the back of the brain, potentially indicative of the parietal lobe or posterior cingulate cortex, also known to be involved in cognitive processes and are affected in Alzheimer's disease and MCI. * • Activity shown around the frontal lobe plays a role in cognitive functions and executive decision-making.\", '2. 6. Discussion': \"From a medical point of view, the use of AI algorithms for the evaluation of fused MRI and PET images presents several distinct advantages over manual evaluations conducted by specialists, particularly in certain contexts. To begin with, the manual evaluation of MRI and PET images is a labor-intensive process that requires specialized training and is susceptible to high measurement variability arising from diverse protocols [](#br0800). In contrast, AI has a remarkable ability to quickly process large volumes of medical imaging data, outpacing human experts in efficiency. This is particularly noteworthy in conditions such as Alzheimer's, where timely detection is of paramount importance. AI's proficiency in scrutinizing intricate patterns within fused MRI and PET scans contributes significantly to the early diagnosis of the disease. AI's forte in pattern recognition empowers it to discern subtle changes or patterns in medical images that may pose challenges for human experts. In addition, algorithms are adept at seamlessly integrating and analyzing diverse datasets, ensuring a high level of consistency in evaluations. This attribute facilitates a more comprehensive assessment of the patient's condition [](#br0810). This consistency is of particular significance in the longitudinal monitoring of disease progression over time. Current diagnostic approaches for AD begin to focus primarily on modern imaging modalities, with a distinct focus on detecting either amyloid deposition or neurodegeneration [](#br0800). The study's findings affirm the capacity of AI to make meaningful contributions to early diagnosis, demonstrating its accuracy in distinguishing between various stages of the disease. This reinforces the notion that AI, with its efficiency, pattern recognition capabilities, and consistent evaluations, holds significant promise in enhancing medical diagnostics and patient care. The results (see [Table 3](#tbl0030)) indicate that a highly effective multiscale fusion technique can be achieved when images are fused at the sixth level of the LP. This finding is significant, as it suggests that image fusion can be optimized by selecting the appropriate level of the LP. The fused images produced using this technique were found to be sufficiently detailed replicas of the original images, as confirmed by the SSIM readings at level 6 of the LP. Specifically, 0.64 for AD on PET images and 0.60 for AD on MRI images. The average PSNR was approximately 34.80 dB, and the average MSE was approximately 0.213. The quality of the fusion method suggested that our method maintained the spatial information of the magnetic resonance image and the spectral characteristics of the PET images [](#br0820), and this provides further evidence that our proposed method achieved a fused image of good quality. After training different variants of ViT (Simple and Deep) and Mobile ViT on our fused data, we discovered that the Pareto-optimized approach of MViT achieved higher accuracy than the other two ViT variants. As shown in [Table 5](#tbl0050), our proposed method, which uses Pareto optimization on a mobile ViT and MRI / PET fusion data, performed better than traditional image fusion techniques and deep learning algorithms used with the two ViT variants were selected. The ablation study result depicted in [Table 8](#tbl0080) shows that there are no significant changes in training accuracy across different variations of the fused image (with or without sharpening and SPCNN) when compared to [Table 5](#tbl0050), and this suggests that the model might be effectively learning from the training data regardless of the specific preprocessing techniques applied to the input images. The consistency in training accuracy across different variations of the fused image shows that the model is capable of learning from the provided training data regardless of whether sharpening or SPCNN is applied. This could indicate that other factors, such as the inherent quality and informativeness of the training data, are more influential in determining training accuracy. [Table 9](#tbl0090), [Table 10](#tbl0100), and [Table 11](#tbl0110) depicts the ablation study results when the model is tested with test data, the model trained with Fused image without sharpening and SPCNN, Fused image without sharpening but with SPCNN, and Fused image without SPCNN but with sharpening respectively. The model trained with fused image with sharpening and SPCNN generalized well as shown in [Table 6](#tbl0060) with 9.73% increament in accuracy for AD vs CN on ADNI (MRI). Although the impact of SPCNN is not so significant as seen in [Table 10](#tbl0100), in which 0.18% increment was achieved in AD vs CN on ADNI (MRI) test data. However, the fact that the model trained with the fused image with sharpening and SPCNN generalized well on the test data indicates that these preprocessing techniques help to improve the model's ability to perform well on unseen data. Sharpening enhances the structural details in the images, while SPCNN fusion integrates both structural and functional information effectively, leading to a more informative representation for the model to learn from. Overfitting was able to be controlled by augmenting the data and with the use of weight decay regularization during optimization, which encourages the weights of the model to be smaller. GLP and SPCNN provide several benefits compared to the DWT. To begin with, both methods excel at maintaining image details and reducing noise, leading to superior image representations. Additionally, SPCNN exhibits greater resilience to image distortions and fluctuations compared to DWT, making it a more efficient option for practical image processing tasks. The combination of SPCNN and GLP has been shown to deliver better results with respect to low feature dimensionality, as DWT breaks images into sub-bands of predetermined bandwidths, while GLP allows greater flexibility in selecting the bandwidth for each subband [](#br0830). The GLP-SPCNN combination outperforms DWT and other approaches, offering advantages like maintaining image details, reducing noise, and being more resistant to distortions. GLP-enabled mobile ViT achieved 100% specificity in identifying CN and MCI without mis-classification. It surpasses other ViT variants and image fusion techniques in AD classification accuracy, addressing overfitting through data augmentation, regularization (dropout), epochs and learning rate scheduler. [Fig. 5](#fg0060) shows that the utilization of 0.3 dropout, learning rate scheduler (mode = min, patience = 2), and epochs of 100) controlled the overfitting of the model. The proposed model enables better spatial connections between AD class features, leading to precise AD stage classification. It achieved a low false positive rate, ensuring a reliable identification of individuals without AD, which makes it promising for enhancing AD imaging across multiple modalities. Brain metabolic region and structural region related to AD, CN, and MCI were localized on individual fused images. The related regions of individuals were partly similar to each other. As shown in [Fig. 6](#fg0070), [Fig. 7](#fg0080), and [Fig. 8](#fg0090). This similarity implies indicates that there are similar regions of interest across the different classes. The combination of MRI and PET data, in particular, can provide the following advantages: * • Magnetic resonance imaging records structural brain integrity, while PET indicates functional alterations related to glucose metabolism or neuronal activity. * **–** The fusion of both of these modalities can build a better association between anatomical brain abnormalities and functional impairments by merging these complementary data, potentially offering a more thorough understanding of the neurodegenerative processes of AD. * **–** The fusion-based approach may provide extra discriminatory information for more accurate differential discrimination and reducing the rate of misdiagnoses. * • The integration of combined MRI and PET data holds the potential to uncover neuroanatomical biomarkers associated with Alzheimer's disease, offering a promising avenue for advancing our understanding of the diagnostic capabilities of computer vision-based approaches.\", '2. 7. Limitations of this study': \"The methods applied in this paper have inherent limitations. The initial manifestations of AD-specific topographic patterns emerge in structures of the medial temporal lobe, including the entorhinal and perirhinal cortex, as well as the hippocampus. Although decreased hippocampus volume, assessed in magnetic resonance images, is commonly used to evaluate AD pathology, it is important to note that hippocampal atrophy is not exclusively indicative of AD and is rarely adequate for a definitive diagnosis. Instead, it is considered a biomarker for neurodegeneration [](#br0840). Several cross-sectional studies have indicated that entorhinal cortex measurements do not provide significantly greater benefits over hippocampal volumetry to distinguish AD patients from the control group, despite the potentially higher accuracy in volumetric evaluations. As a result, MRI findings, while valuable, should be interpreted in conjunction with other relevant findings to avoid potentially misleading conclusions [](#br0850). In PET tomography, hypometabolism in the temporoparietal regions is recognized as a diagnostic criterion for AD. However, it is important to recognize that the glucose uptake measured in this context reflects astrocyte function rather than neuronal function. PET can also estimate the accumulation of Amyloid-_β_ (A _β_), the first hallmark of AD. However, A _β_ accumulation tends to plateau as the disease progresses. Furthermore, different subtypes of AD exhibit diverse changes in metabolic patterns, which decreases the diagnostic accuracy of FDG-PET. Consequently, FDG-PET is currently not recommended for the preclinical diagnosis of AD due to the challenge of verifying whether hypometabolism is directly related to AD pathology [](#br0860). A synergistic approach involving both structural and functional imaging, assessed through AI, holds promise as a potential solution to the challenging task of differentiating Alzheimer's disease from other conditions. This integrated methodology leverages the strengths of structural and functional data, offering a more comprehensive understanding of the brain's status. AI becomes a valuable tool designed to complement healthcare professionals, offering them additional insight and improving overall efficiency in the diagnostic process. However, it is imperative to recognize that the effectiveness of AI is dependent on the quality of the algorithms used and the specificity of their application. Rigorous validation in real-life conditions and continuous refinement of these algorithms are still essential to ensure their reliability and relevance in clinical settings. While the use of external test data, such as the small sample extracted from the OASIS database, offers a valuable opportunity for validation, it also introduces limitations. The small size of the external test dataset, driven by the limited number of subjects who meet specific inclusion criteria, particularly for AD dementia, underscores the challenge of generalizing the findings to broader populations. This limitation highlights the need for caution when extrapolating results and emphasizes the importance of further validation efforts, preferably with larger and more diverse datasets, to enhance the robustness and applicability of AI-based approaches in clinical practice.\", '2. 8. Conclusion and future works': \"The study presented an algorithm for classifying different stages of AD using fused images obtained from sMRI and FDG-PET imaging. The results showed promise, showing a good level of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in distinguishing Alzheimer's disease dementia from normal cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease dementia from mild cognitive impairment, and normal cognitive from mild cognitive impairment. This innovative approach, which uses a Pareto-optimized MViT model with GLP and SPCNN for image fusion, could overcome the limitations of error-prone feature selection techniques in multimodal imaging. By applying vision-transformer models for image categorization and fusion, more accurate and reliable AD analysis might be achievable, providing complementary data from multiple imaging modalities. The results of the OASIS and ADNI datasets suggest that this method could aid in early diagnosis, potentially improving patient outcomes and quality of life. With further validation and refinement, this technique could become a valuable tool for early identification of AD. Apromising avenue for the future research lies in enhancing the discriminatory capability of our diagnostic method to distinguish between amnestic and atypical presentations of AD. These distinct presentations may entail different patterns of brain involvement, and further optimization of our technique could yield insights into the specific brain areas affected in these varied AD subtypes. Such refinements hold the potential to contribute to more personalized approaches to diagnosis and treatment. Another intriguing direction for future exploration involves investigating the diagnostic value of our novel technique in distinguishing AD from other neurodegenerative disorders, such as frontotemporal lobar degenerations, Lewy body disorders, tauopathies, TDP-43 proteinopathies, and synucleinopathies. Given the potential overlap in affected brain regions among these conditions, our method could play a crucial role in providing clarity during the challenging process of making differential diagnoses, having the potential to significantly enhance our ability to differentiate AD from a spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders, thereby facilitating more accurate and timely clinical decisions. Finally, the integration of additional imaging modalities or clinical data could help to further enhance the precision and reliability of the approach, as would the further analysis of different high-pass filters, which could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the various factors that influence multimodal fusion in medical imaging analysis.\", '2.
